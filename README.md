# Prompt Architectures Workshop

Text-To-SQL, Text-To-Code, RAGIn this session attendees will explore specialized prompt architectures for complex use cases like Text-to-SQL, Text-to-Code, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This session will focus on designing robust prompt structures tailored to specific tasks, emphasizing techniques such as schema incorporation, context retrieval, and multi-step prompting. Participants will learn how to craft effective prompts for generating SQL queries from natural language, translating instructions into functional code, and leveraging external knowledge bases to enhance AI outputs. By mastering these specialized architectures, attendees will be able to tackle sophisticated real-world applications, unlocking the full potential of large language models across various technical domains.
